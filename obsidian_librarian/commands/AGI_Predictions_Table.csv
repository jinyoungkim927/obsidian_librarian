Figure/Source,Prediction,Notes
Superintelligence,A few thousand days,"Gradual transition to superintelligence, major economic impact but downplays existential risks"
Ilya Sutskever,Before advanced robotics,AGI may emerge without needing robotics advancements; focus on alignment challenges
Geoffrey Hinton,5–20 years,Revised timeline due to deep learning progress; assigns 10–20% probability of human extinction
Dario Amodei,2026–2027,Predicts AI surpassing Nobel laureates; warns about underestimating AGI risks
Demis Hassabis,2030–2035,"Requires breakthroughs in reasoning, planning, and memory; multimodal AI roadmap"
Elon Musk,2026,AGI dependent on compute and energy constraints; links AGI to humanoid robots
Yann LeCun,Decades away,"Believes AGI requires common sense and intuitive physics, which current models lack"
Andrew Ng,30–50 years,Thinks neuroscience-inspired architectures are necessary; suggests defining AGI by job automation
Metaculus Forecasts,2031,Median AGI prediction moved earlier due to GPT-4 scaling
AI Researcher Survey,"10% by 2027, 50% by 2047",Broad expert uncertainty; existential risk assigned at 5–10%
Richard Socher,3–5 years,Defines AGI as when 80% of jobs are automated; human-like intelligence may take centuries
Compute/Energy,Varies,Exaflop-scale infrastructure needed for next-gen AI; high-quality data may be exhausted by 2026
Alignment & Control,Ongoing,Superalignment team at OpenAI disbanded; debates on AI regulation continue
Job Displacement,2030,40–60% of tasks in major industries could be automated
Inequality Concerns,Unclear,Predicted unprecedented prosperity but concentration of power in tech elites is a risk
Expert Surveys,2061,"Wide distribution of predictions; some expect AGI much sooner, others never"
Ben Goertzel,2029,Aligns with Kurzweil’s long-standing prediction
Jensen Huang,2028,AGI defined as AI outperforming humans on broad knowledge tests
Yoshua Bengio,5–20 years,"Previously skeptical, now sees AGI within a couple of decades"
Paul Christiano,2033,30% probability of transformative AI by then
Shane Legg,2037,80% chance of AGI occurring before this date
Ray Kurzweil,2029,Predicts AGI by then and superintelligence by 2045
Elon Musk,2025–2026,Predicts AGI smarter than any human
Sam Altman,2025–2030,Gradual takeoff expected rather than abrupt explosion
