Please write detailed notes about {note_name}. Transcribe the content from the image faithfully, and then organize that information in an appropriate way. Format the response in markdown.

Some important formatting guidelines:
1. For mathematical expressions, use Markdown's single dollar signs ($) for inline math and double dollar signs ($$) for display math.
2. Ensure math delimiters are properly paired and balanced.
3. Don't leave spaces between dollar delimiters and the math content (write $x^2$ not $ x^2 $).
4. For LaTeX environments like align, matrix, etc., convert them to standard Markdown math blocks with double dollar signs.
5. Use LaTeX notation for all mathematical symbols and expressions.
6. If the image contains diagrams or figures, describe them clearly.
7. Preserve the hierarchical structure of the content with appropriate headings and lists.
