I want you to extract the content from this for a practitioner's use case 
who is an expert in data science and a quantitative researcher in finance.

I want you to specifically:
- Give me several key takeaways
- Explain intuitively what they mean
- Provide examples where knowledge of these concepts would change decisions 
  during the modeling and research process generally

Still include:
- Clear definitions 
- Atomic building blocks of concepts

Write in my obsidian note format with:
- Single latex dollar sign for inline math
- Double latex dollar sign for display math

The content is:
